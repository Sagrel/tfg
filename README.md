This is my final proyect for my university degree in Software Engineering. It's a webpage that user React and the componen library Mantine.

It connects to Firebase for authentication and data storage. Also uses Imgur to upload images.

The code quality is not the best as the time given to complete the proyect was limited and we are encouraged to add more flashy features over making the code readable and high quality.
